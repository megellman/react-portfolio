I specialize in troubleshooting complex issues, reproducing bugs, and translating technical problems into clear, durable solutions.

Through hands-on support work and UC Berkeley’s full-stack program, I’ve built a strong foundation in APIs, debugging, system behavior, and documentation. I thrive in roles where reliability, clarity, and deep product understanding directly impact users, with a long-term interest in growing into engineering-adjacent work.
